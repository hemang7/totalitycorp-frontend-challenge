I've used various components to make various parts of the Twitter homepage, also I've used react icons to represent various icons that are used on Twitter. This project is entirely done in React js. For styling purposes, CSS layout such as flexbox have been used to style different parts of the application. The approach was to make different components and then join them together to act as single application.
